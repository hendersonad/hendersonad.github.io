*	Established the early career researcher working group within the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at LSHTM. The group has regular meetings to discuss work as well as a journal club. 
*	Member of the organisation committee for IDDconf, a conference for approximately 100 UK based modellers hosted at University of Cumbria, Ambleside. 
### Public Engagement
*	Co-created and co-lead a public engagement project “Outbreak control: an introduction to careers in public health”. A two-hour workshop simulating a malaria outbreak with interactive activities introducing GCSE students to possible careers in public health. Hosted by 6 schools and at the Royal Institution to date. 
*	Led and mentored on LSHTM’s “Young Scientist Programme”, which gives school students aged 14-17 experience leading their own research project over a two-week placement. 
*	Facilitated the “Perspectivity Challenge Public Health Board Game”. Players have to play collaboratively or competitively to improve the global health index. Game has been played at Haverstock School in North London and with adults at “Bedford Council Public Health Away Day”.

## Funding and awards
