## Electronic health records

I am currently conducting research using electronic healht records from the UK. I am using primary care records to analyse the factors that contribute to worse mental health outcomes in people with skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. I have also used primary care data to analyse the pattern of consultations for [acute health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in England](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(21)00017-0), and analysed [multimorbidity in people with allergic conditions](https://hendersonad.github.io/MICAC/).


## Mathematical modelling 
As part of my PhD research I used mathematical models with multiple data sources to better understand the transmission of DENV and ZIKV. Specifically, I analysed serological data to improve understanding of population immune dynamics following arbovirus outbreaks and mathematical models to identify the determinants of arbovirus transmission dynamics in island outbreaks.
